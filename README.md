# Project Name
> Project by Ankit Chandre

This project employs regularization techniques to build a polynomial regression model for predicting the actual value of prospective properties, aiding in investment decisions. The primary goals are:

Identifying significant variables in predicting house prices.
Evaluating how well these variables describe house prices.

> The project includes:

A Data Analysis notebook
A folder containing images (visualizations created by me, photo from Unsplash)
The dataset train.csv
The data dictionary datainfo.txt
Answers to the subjective questions in PDF format SubjectiveQuestions.pdf

Assignment Steps Performed in the Notebook

Data Visualization
Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand various variables.
Check correlations between the variables.
Data Preparation
Clean the data structure.
Remove unnecessary variables.
Create dummy variables for all categorical features.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Perform scaling.
Separate data into dependent and independent variables.
Data Modeling and Evaluation
Create a linear regression model without regularization.
Develop models using Ridge and Lasso regularization.
Create additional models using a mixed approach (RFE & VIF/p-Value) and apply Ridge regularization.
Report the final model.

## General Information

Overview

Context: A US-based housing company, Surprise Housing, is entering the Australian market. They aim to purchase houses below their actual values and sell them at higher prices using data analytics.

Business Problem: The goal is to model house prices using available variables, enabling the management to understand price dynamics and formulate strategies to maximize returns in a new market.
